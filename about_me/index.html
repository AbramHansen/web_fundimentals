    <h2>Abram Hansen</h2>
    <p>I am a junior here at BYU-I and am studying software engineering.
        I grew up in Casper Wyoming but have lived in New Mexico, California and now Idaho.
        My hobbies include photography, VR gaming, and of course software engineering.
        I am married the the wonderful Fabiola and we are expecting a baby girl this July!
        I have been a memeber of the church all my life and served in the California Rancho Cucamonga and Arcadia missions.
        My favorite scripture is Romans 6:20-23.
        I think taking this course will help me explore other career options as I havet yet considered much in the web side of software engineering.</p>
